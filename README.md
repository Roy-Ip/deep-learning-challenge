  - "Images" folder - it contains images for the Neural Network Model Analysis Report.
  - Neural Network Model Analysis Report - it is the analysis report containing the overview, result and summary of the Neural Network Model analysis. 
  - AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimisation_10_accuracy_0.7271 - it is the Jupyter Notebook of the 10th attempt (the highest accuracy percentage).
  - AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimisation_10 - it is the H5 file of the 10th attempt.
